# PatroniMonitor

PatroniMonitor is a web application that connects to your patroni cluster and helps you manage the individual nodes and the cluster's configuration and settings. This project was created as a proof of concept during my internship to present my idea of simplifying and improving the management and monitoring of patroni clusters.
